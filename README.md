# **How does the Internet Work?**

First, we start with the front end. The front end is inputed and sends what it is looking for to routing. Routing then tells the back end, what the front end needed. Backend then checks with the database to find what that need was. Then it is sent back to the then front end through routing.

# **What do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do?**

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all work together to make a website function properly while looking good. HTML creates the base for the webstie with the text and division of classes and id's. CSS creates the style of the website including colors, placement, and other creative elements. Javascript allows any functionality of a website including working buttons, inputs, or any other user oriented actions.
